## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a one-shot face recognition system using a Siamese network. One-shot learning is a technique where the model is trained to recognize new classes based on seeing just one or a few examples. In the realm of face recognition, this translates to recognizing a person's face from a single or very few images.

## Siamese Network Overview

A Siamese network is a specialized neural network architecture. Instead of a model learning to classify its inputs, the neural network learns to differentiate between two inputs. It learns to recognize the similarity or difference between two images, making it perfect for face verification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhhoang2705/siamese-net-face-reg.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd siamese-net-face-reg
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `siamese_model.ipynb` notebook from the Jupyter dashboard.

3. Execute the cells in sequence to preprocess the data, define the Siamese network architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
